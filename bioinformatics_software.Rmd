Before using any of the following tools, don't underestimate the power of basic linux
tools such as less, grep, awk, cut, uniq, wc

## Sequence processing

-   **seqtk** (easy and fast) or **seqkit** (more powerful, but more complex)
-   **emboss**: suite of bioinformatics programs for sequence analysis:
    -   translation (with ORF identification)
    -   N-W alignments
    -   transformation, such as reverse complements
    -   sequence summary
-   **bioawk**

## Alignment

-   local sequence alignment: **blast** or **diamond** (faster but less sensitive)
-   fast global sequence alignment: **minimap2**
-   reads on contigs: **bwa** or **bowtie2**

## QC

-   **fastqc**
-   **multiqc**
-   **quast**
